Use the Go SDK for [the Satori platform](https://www.satori.com/) to create applications that use the
RTM to publish and subscribe.

## Go SDK Installation

Use a `go-get` tool (or any go-compatible package manager) to download the SDK:
```
go get github.com/satori-com/satori-rtm-sdk-go/rtm
```

Import the SDK in your go file:
```
import "github.com/satori-com/satori-rtm-sdk-go/rtm"
```

*It is highly recommended to use tags to lock the SDK version for your project.*

## Documentation and Examples

Latest Go SDK documentation is [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/satori-com/satori-rtm-sdk-go/rtm)

## Logging and Debugging

Go SDK logs information to STDOUT/STDERR. To enable debug level,
set DEBUG_SATORI_SDK environment variable to `true`:
```bash
$ DEBUG_SATORI_SDK=true go run <your_program.go>
```

or 

```bash
$ export DEBUG_SATORI_SDK=true
$ go run <your_program.go>
```

Debug level outputs all underlying communication with RTM, in addition to SDK execution info.  
Example:
```bash
$ DEBUG_SATORI_SDK=true go run <your_app.go>

```


## Using HTTPS Proxy

The SDK supports working through an https (not http) proxy.

When creating a new client specify `HttpsProxy` in `Options` like this:

```
client, err := rtm.New("<your-endpoint>", "<your-appkey>", rtm.Options{
    HttpsProxy: rtm.Proxy{
        Host: "127.0.0.1",
        Port: 1234,
    },
})
```

## Tests and Coverage Report

Tests require a valid RTM endpoint; RTM credentials should be populated in `credentials.json`.

The `credentials.json` file must include the following key-value pairs:
```json
{
  "endpoint": "wss://<SATORI_HOST>/",
  "appkey": "<APP_KEY>",
  "auth_role_name": "<ROLE_NAME>",
  "auth_role_secret_key": "<ROLE_SECRET_KEY>",
  "auth_restricted_channel": "<CHANNEL_NAME>"
}
```

- `endpoint` is your customer-specific DNS name for RTM access.
- `appkey` is your application key.
- `auth_role_name` is a role name that permits to publish / subscribe to `auth_restricted_channel`. Must be not `default`.
- `auth_role_secret_key` is a secret key for `auth_role_name`.
- `auth_restricted_channel` is a channel with subscribe and publish access for `auth_role_name` role only.

You must use [DevPortal](https://developer.satori.com/) to create role and set channel permissions.

After setting up `credentials.json`, run SDK tests with the following commands:
```
$ go get github.com/satori-com/satori-sdk-go/rtm
$ CREDENTIALS=/full/path/to/credentials.json go test ./src/github.com/satori-com/satori-rtm-sdk-go/...
```

### Coverage report

Use the `-cover` flag to get Coverage report. The `-coverprofile` flag produces debug profile file that
allows to analyse untested parts of SDK.

```
$ CREDENTIALS=/full/path/to/credentials.json go test ./src/github.com/satori-com/satori-rtm-sdk-go/rtm -cover -coverprofile cover.out
$ go tool cover -html=cover.out -o rtm.html
```

Now you can open the `rtm.html` file to check uncovered parts of code.

### Race conditions detection

Use the `-race` flag to enable [Race conditions detection](https://golang.org/doc/articles/race_detector.html). It is highly recommended to use this flag
when running the tests.

```
$ CREDENTIALS=/full/path/to/credentials.json go test ./src/github.com/satori-com/satori-rtm-sdk-go/... -race
```
